# Features

## 1. Built-in Code Editor with Code Save capabilities

![Code Editor](/public/assets/images/preview2.png)

#### With Codeforces Lite, you can now write, time, and submit code directly from the problem page. No need to switch tabs or upload files manually.

Key features include:
- Default language selector for easy switching between programming languages.
- Adjustable font size for a customized coding experience.
- Built-in timer for practicing timed coding problems.
- Options to reset your code and automatic tab indentation.

 Along with this, your submitted codes are saved locally and can be retrieved when you revisit the same problem. The storage system is designed to handle over 1000+ code files, with each file being up to 200+ lines long, by automatically managing storage and deleting older codes to make space for newer ones.

 This is done by an efficient storage management system using HashMap and Queue.

## 2. Dark Theme

#### Codeforces Lite offers a highly optimized dark theme designed to provide a more visually comfortable experience, especially during extended coding sessions. The dark theme ensures a consistent look throughout the entire platform.

#### Key features of the dark theme include:

- **Eye Comfort:** The dark theme reduces eye strain by minimizing the contrast between the screen and the environment, particularly in low-light conditions.
- **Battery Efficiency:** On devices with OLED or AMOLED screens, the dark theme can help conserve battery life by reducing the energy used to display brighter pixels.
- **Code Readability:** Syntax highlighting is optimized for better readability in dark mode, ensuring that different elements in the code—such as keywords, variables, and comments—stand out clearly without causing visual fatigue.
- **User Control:** You can toggle the dark theme on or off based on your preferences, allowing you to switch between light and dark modes seamlessly.


## 3. Custom Templates and Default Cursor Placement

#### With Codeforces Lite, you can set up custom templates that automatically load whenever you start solving a new problem. This feature helps you avoid the repetitive task of setting up your environment or writing boilerplate code from scratch.

#### By predefining your commonly used template (such as input/output functions, imports, or debugging statements), you can focus directly on problem-solving, improving your speed and efficiency during contests or practice sessions.

#### Additionally, you can specify the exact position for your cursor using the `$0` symbol in your template, allowing you to start typing right where you need. The extension also remembers the cursor’s position when switching tabs and revisiting problems, ensuring you pick up exactly where you left off—saving valuable time during contests.

## 4. UI Enhancements

#### Codeforces Lite enhances the overall UI of Codeforces by making it more accessible, visually appealing, and user-friendly.

#### Elements are optimized for better positioning, creating a clean and intuitive interface for seamless navigation.

- Improved alignment of the problemset page for a more structured look.
- Redesigned login and register pages for a smoother user experience.
- Customized dark theme for various extension components to ensure consistency with our dark theme design.
- **User Control:** You can easily toggle the `Change UI` option on or off according to your preferences, allowing you to switch seamlessly between the default user interface and the enhanced version.
